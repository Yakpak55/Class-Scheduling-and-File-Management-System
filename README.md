# Class-Scheduling-and-File-Management-System
 Developed a Java program to manage class schedules and handle file input/output operations for the Computer Science Department (CSD) at UCF. 
 
 The project involved:

● File Parsing and Data Extraction: Read and parsed a text file (lec.txt) containing details of lectures and labs, extracting information such as CRNs, course numbers, titles, locations, modalities, and graduate/undergraduate status.
● Class Counting: Implemented functionality to count the number of online classes offered by the department, providing a summary of the results.
● Location-Based CRN Search: Developed a feature to search and display CRNs of lectures and labs held in a specified classroom, enhancing the ability to manage room allocations.
● Output File Generation: Created a new text file (lecturesOnly.txt) listing all online lectures and lectures with no labs, ensuring the accurate reflection of the current class schedule.
● User Interaction: Designed a command-line interface for user interaction, allowing input for classroom searches and displaying relevant information based on user queries.
